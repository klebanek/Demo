## 2026-02-13 - [No Build System]
**Learning:** This project is a vanilla JS PWA with no build system (no package.json, no webpack/vite). Optimization must happen directly in source files (e.g. index.html).
**Action:** Always check for package.json first. If missing, assume manual file editing and lack of standard lint/test commands.
